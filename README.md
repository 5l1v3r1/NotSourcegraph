# Uh, what? Why?
I was playing around with tracking things in OpenCV and realized that I have alot of Sourcegraph merch around that is perfect to use as trackers. A _certain somebody_ convinced me to make it into a [Not Hotdog](https://github.com/shaqian/Not-Hotdog) clone, complete with really bad image overlays that I made in a few seconds in gimp.
