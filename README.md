# Usage
* Requires Python 3
1. `git clone https://github.com/Andoryuuta/NotSourcegraph.git`
2. `cd NotSourcegraph`
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (Windows: `py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4. `python3 NotSourcegraph.py` (Windows: `py -3 NotSourcegraph.py`)

# Uh, what? Why?
I was playing around with tracking things in OpenCV and realized that I have alot of Sourcegraph merch around that is perfect to use as trackers. A _certain somebody_ convinced me to make it into a [Not Hotdog](https://github.com/shaqian/Not-Hotdog) clone, complete with really bad image overlays that I made in a few seconds in gimp.
